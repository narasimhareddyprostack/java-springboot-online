Java - Object Oriented Programming Language
-------------------------------------------

class Test{
public static void main(String[] args){
 System.out.println("Hello, world');
 }
}

After Installing Java into machine.

Why we need to set the classpath/patch
how to set the classpath?
>javac 
working fine.


C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.0.2\bin

comipler / Interpretator
--------
comipler is software it convert high-level code to low level binary format code.
Human Readable format to machine readable binary format.

Java is comipler based programming laguage.

Java Programming features?

Object Oriented Programming Language
Simple
platform indipendetn
Architectural Neutral
Portable
Multithreaded
Distributed and networked
High Performance
Secure & Robust
==========================================
Identifier
A name in java program is called identifier. It can be 
class name 
variable name 
method 
label name 

class Test{
	public static void mian(String[] args){
	int x = 100;
   }
}

Rules to define identifier:
The only allowed characters in java identifier are :

a to Z 
A to Z
0 to 9 
_
& 

If we are using any other characters we will get compile Time Error.

class #Order{}  - Error 

2)Identifier can't start with digit.

class 9Test{}   - Not allowed   
class Test9{}

3)Identifier are case Sensitive 
int a = 100;
int A = 100;
class Test{}
class TEST{}

4)There is no lenght limit for java identifiers.
 
class Testttttttttttttttttttt{}

5)We cant use Reserved words/keywords are identifiers.


Which of the following are valid identifiers?

9Test        - No 
total_Order_Cost - Yes 
_Test_      - Yes
total#      - No 
int         - No 
Integer     - ok 

Data Type
-----------
Java is Strictly Typed Programming Language.

Java Programming Language - 3 Data types 
1.Pre-defined / Premitive Data Types 
2.Derived Data Types       
3.User Defined Data Types / Object 

Primitive Data Types 

byte: - 
====
size : 8 bits (1 Byte)
Max_Value: 127 
Min_Value: -128
Range : -128 to 127 

short :
==========
size: 2 - byte
Range :-32768  to 32767 

summary of primitive Data Types:
        
byte    1-byte 
short   2-byte 
int     4-byte 
long    8-byte 

float    4-byte
double   8-byte

char     2-byte 
boolean  N/A

2.Derived Data Type 

int size[] = {38, 40 ,42, 44};
String names[] = {"Narasimha","Suchitra", "Srikanth"};


3.User Defined Data Types(Objects)



Arrays
============

Array is indexed collection of fixed no of homogenous data elements.

-group of homogenous data elements as one entity - nothing but array

Array Declaration
1.int[] a;     a is int array 
2.int a[];
3.int []a;

and 
Array Creation

int[] a = new int[3];


length - It represetns the size of array 
       -It is final variable applicable for arrays
length() - it is final method applicable for string object.
        -It represents the no of characters in string.
